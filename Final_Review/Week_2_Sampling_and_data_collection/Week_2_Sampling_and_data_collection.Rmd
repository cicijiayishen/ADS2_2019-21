# LO:

1. Explain the relationship between a population and a sample

2. Explain the concept of sampling bias

3. Give examples of sampling biases that can occur

4. Design data collection procedures that avoid sampling bias

# Notes:

- Inferential statistics

Draw conclusions about the population from knowledge of a sample.

- Sampling error

The *difference* between sample and population. (Not mistake.)

- Sampling bias

If samples are not random and individuals in the population do not have equal probability of being sampled, there will be sampling bias.

- Sampling bias can be avoided by designing better.
