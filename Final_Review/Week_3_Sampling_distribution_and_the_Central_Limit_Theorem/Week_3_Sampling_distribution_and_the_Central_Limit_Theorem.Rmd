# LO:

1. Explain the Central Limit Theorem

2. Define the standard error of the mean

3. Compare sampling distributions and underlying population distributions

4. Describe a normal distribution and explain its importance

# Notes:

- 68-95-99.7 rule

0.1%-2.1%-13.6%-34.1%

- Sampling distribution

Take samples of size n from a normal distribution and record their means.

- Standard Error of the Mean (SEM)

SEM = sd / sqrt(n)

How well your sample mean estimates the true population mean.

The greater SEM, the more different is the sample with population.
