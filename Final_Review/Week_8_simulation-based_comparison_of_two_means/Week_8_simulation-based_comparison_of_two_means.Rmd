# LO:

1. Understand the logic behind hypothesis tests using simulations

2. Learn how to compare mean of a sample from a distribution to a value

3. Learn how to compare means of two samples from two distributions

4. Appreciate the advantages of simulation-based approach

# Notes:

- How to calculate cumulative distribution function (cdf)?

pnorm(n)

or qnorm() in reverse from cdf to n.

- The difference of means from two distributions depends on effect size and sample size.

# Functions:

runif(n, min = 0, max = 1)

replicate(n, function)

par(new = TRUE) # set or query graphical parameters.
